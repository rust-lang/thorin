# `thorin`
`thorin` is an DWARF packaging utility for creating DWARF packages (`*.dwp` files) out of input
DWARF objects (`*.dwo` files; or `*.o` files with `.dwo` sections), supporting both the pre-standard
GNU extension format for DWARF packages and the standardized format introduced in DWARF 5.

`thorin` was written as part of the implementation of Split DWARF in `rustc`. A Rust implementation
of a DWARF packaging utility is easier to integrate into the compiler and can support features like
loading dwarf objects from archive files (or rustc's rlibs) which are helpful in supporting
cross-crate Split DWARF packaging in `rustc`.

## Usage
To use `thorin` in your own project, add it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
thorin-dwp = "0.7.0"
```

See the [`thorin-bin`](../thorin-bin/README.md) crate for an example of using `thorin`'s library
interface.

## Stability
`thorin`'s library interface is intended for use by `rustc` for its *Split DWARF* support, it
currently comes with no stability guarantees and may change at any time.

#### Name
<sup>
<code>thorin</code> is named after <i>Thorin Oakenshield</i> from <i>The Hobbit</i>, as Thorin is
a dwarf who leads other dwarves. <code>thorin</code> uses the <code>gimli</code> library
(named after a dwarf from <i>Lord of the Rings</i>) to read <i>DWARF</i> format debug information,
the name of which is a medieval fantasy complement to <i>ELF</i>, the file format for executables
and object files.
